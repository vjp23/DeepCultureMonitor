# DeepCultureMonitor
A Raspberry Pi-based monitoring and control system for deep water culture (DWC) hydroponics.


Supports pH, EC, temperature, and water level monitoring and water level adjustments via solenoid control.

Roadmap:
- Light level monitoring (on/off, and then lux measurement)
- Relay control for switching reservoir drain pump, top feed pump, and lighting
- Support peristaltic pump control
- Support max/min limits for water level, pH, and EC with automated fertigation/water level adjustments
- Control using P(I)D control
- Full grow lifecycle automation
- Configurable alerts via email and/or SMS
